Our computers, are fast: and, have vast amounts of memory @#$and could be;; very helpful
to us if we only knew the language to speak to explain to the computer what we
would like it to 'do' next. If we knew this language, we could tell the computer
to do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive. Interestingly, the kinds of things
computers !can! do best are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring
and mind-numbing.
