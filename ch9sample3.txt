A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the index positions have to
be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.
You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are
called keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a
key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.
As an example, we'll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words,
so the keys and the values are all strings.
The function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the
name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.
