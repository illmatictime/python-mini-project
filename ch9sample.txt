A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the index positions have to
be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.

You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.

As an example, we'll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words,
so the keys and the values are all strings.
The function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the
name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.
The order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same
example on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order
of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.
But that's not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed
with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:
